Note, you must run the following in Bash (suggest saving it in your ```.bashrc```)
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=[directory to two-sigma-financial-news]:$PYTHONPATH
```
Substitute [directory to two-sigma-financial-news] for the directory to where you cloned this repo.

Doing this is mandatory for the Jupyter Notebooks to read the notebooks hierarchy correctly.
